# LitenWiki
Very tiny wiki implementation in PHP. It's super efficient in terms of memory (for a PHP script), but not suitable for too serious use, since there is no system against spam or other forms of griefing.

## Installation
1. Drop the files into the desired folder on your web server
2. Edit config.php to suit your needs
3. Done.
